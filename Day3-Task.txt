           The windows and document objects are described in the 
DOM Tree(Document Object Model Tree).Window and objects have  
different properties , methods, and functionality .We can access a 
document object either using windows. Document  property or using 
document object directly as window is global object. 
Ex: windows have open and closed Button. But document don’t have that buttons.

                                     Windows

       • Windows is the global object.
       •The windows is the topmost loaded into the browser.
       •It is like a main tab of the browser.

           • Users can see in the screen .
           • It has height and width.
   
 

                                 Document:

       •The document Object is inside of the windows object.
       •It is like a subtitle. It is a sub menu of the windows browser.
